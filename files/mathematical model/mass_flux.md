<h2> Mass Flux </h2>


The mass flux is then defined as:

$$ J_i = M_i \left ( \frac{\delta E}{\delta\varphi_i} \right ) \nabla\varphi_i $$

Where $M_i$ is the cell mobility.

So when taking the divergence:

$$ \nabla \cdot J_i = M_i (\nabla \cdot\left ( \frac{\delta E}{\delta\varphi_i} \right ) \nabla\varphi_i  + \left ( \frac{\delta E}{\delta\varphi_i} \right ) \nabla^2\varphi_i )$$

It can be seen that this is the diffusive term governed by the adhesion energy of the cells. This term ensures the tumor sticks together.
